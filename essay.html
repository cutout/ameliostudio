					<p>The hoary, clumsy, cryptic days of the web. I miss them.</p>

					<p>Around this time came a big transition. Being a recent college grad who admired the web from the outside and used it primarily to plumb information about my favorite music to being a full-time HTML jockey for a newly formed web studio in Charlottesville, VA.</p>

					
					<hr />

					<p class="flush"><strong>The long story</strong> is pretty much a writing exercise, an overdue "thank you" letter to the internet, and a "how did I get here?" letter to myself. Together they tell a better story than a r&egrave;sum&egrave; probably could. Plus, I don't remember how to format one of those.</p>

					<p>I have fond memories of many fun projects over the years, but it's always been the medium itself that has motivated me. I had childhood fascinations with pen pals, faraway places and ideas, making and breaking things. The internet is all of that. So I've spent 15 years riding its waves and writing on its walls (sometimes at length, with paragraph indents and reversed type <a class="changeBg" onclick="day();" href="#">on a dark background</a> (you can <a class="changeBg" onclick="day();" href="#">fix that</a> or <a href="#" class="changeBg" onclick="night();">revert</a>) which is not even advisable, depending on who you ask. Another perk of having a personal website: you don't have to ask).</p>

					<blockquote>In some sense we will always be Doozer-like.</blockquote>

					<p>For that matter, it's why the hoary, idiosyncratic <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3037028/why-the-internet-is-time-traveling-back-to-1994" target="_blank">late-90s "personal homepage"</a> style was actually pretty liberating and proved that not knowing what the hell you're doing is useful and possibly never goes away. In the effort to tame and shape the internet, we creatively abuse it. We pick up new formats and standards, but destroy as often as we build. In some sense we will always be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fraggle_Rock_characters#Doozers" target="blank">Doozer-like</a>. Our constructions are devoured when the internet changes shape yet again, we chase more standards and frameworks, but we always happily rebuild, getting better each time. There's no such thing as stable, complete internet. I love that.</p>

					<p>If there's a theme here, maybe it's this: if you're a job-seeking young person who wants to make stuff but didn't go to art school or major in CS or IT or even go to college, the internet will still abide. You can carve out a place for yourself and the internet will expand and accomodate. Your job might require you to be a clinical perfectionist, but remember to be a clumsy explorer. Use "passion" to describe your design approach, but consider it meaningless unless you have a passion for what the internet means to us culturally and the sheer human ingenuity that keeps it going. Maintain your passion for the medium and the rest will probably work itself out.</p>

					<p class="flush">The hoary, clumsy, cryptic days of the web. I miss them.</p>
					
					<p>Charlottesville, VA at that time was an ideal place to appreciate them. At the University of Virginia professors like Jerome McGann (<a href="http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/public/jjm2f/rationale.html" target="_blank">The Rationale of Hypertext</a>)  were experimenting headlong with publishing in the digital landscape. Ancient texts were being dusted off, scanned, poured into new formats, remixed, rediscovered. Right as the internet was going fully mainstream, it was  academics of all people proving that computers could be cool and creative. Web protocols could actually take fiction writing and humanities to a higher place instead of cheapening them.</p> 

					<p>"That's bullshit," is something I probably said at the time.</p>

					<p>I didn't believe any of that at the time.</p>

					<p>(say something about why they were hoary and clumsy and didn't make sense; non-academics were shoehorning their ideas; but I loved them)</p>

					<p>Meanwhile, competing ISPs popped up around Charlottesville, which meant jobs. You could be paid to soak in the internet all day. Nerds were rejoicing in the streets.</p>

					<p>So academics suddenly had groupies and Perl programmers were buying Harleys. What about the recent liberal arts graduates who would have been unemployable in the public sector 10 years before? The ones who would have flunked out of CS if they'd gone that route. The nonspecific creative, curious, vaguely lost-looking ones.</p>

					<p>The web provided. Thing about how the web provides. Making it owrk for us, It changed all our lives.</p>

					<p>Also the web forgave. CS degrees didn't matter. Bachelor's didn't even matter.  

					<p>Suddently there were free workshops to learn XML/HTML and add markup to your poetry or photography projects.</p>

					<p>But most importantly Liberal arts graduates who would have been unemployable a decade before were taking notice. Not to mention handed a mysterious new medium that could host their writing, showcase their photos. Webpages looked terrible at the time and I didn't understand the impact this would all have on my own career and nearly eveyrone I knew. Because I could publish whatever I wanted. Even a longish, indulgent bio on my own website. It's mine. Rationality I can read on the train 20 years later on an app I designed! https://www.readability.com/articles/5dbvstcp</p>


					<p>Nerds were rejoicing in the streets. Writers and nonspecific creative types took notice. If you didn't have a CS degree, the web forgave. Finding entry-points to make a career out of the internet became its own artform. <em>Can I build it? Will someone use it? Will they pay me for it?</em> The concepts of merits and entitlement were reversed: in those days you could pretty much just announce yourself as a Web Designer and get cracking on learning how exactly to do that.</p>

					<blockquote><q>I was never a joiner, but I said pretty quickly, <em>I want to be part of this</em>.</q></blockquote>

					<p>As a kid, I had dreamt of a career in radio or television or magazine writingx. Doing what, it didn't matter. [late 90s ads for ISPs, etc] . When it really went mainstream, it looked like a slow-moving, amorphous Oort-cloud of knowledge and opportunity that expanded every day and pulled every nerd into it. It was the most promising and most ominous thing I'd ever seen. I was never a joiner, but I said pretty quickly, <em>I want to be part of this</em>.</p>
					
					

					<p>Somewhere in there, English and humanities majors around Charlottesville formed web design studios instead of applying to grad school. Not knowing any better, a group of them hired me as the first employee of Category 4, now <a href="https://www.weareconvoy.com/" target=_"blank">Convoy</a>. I was tasked with writing HTML alongside Perl programmers and making frequent Wild-West updates to webpages right on the live server via FTP. Those early experiences continue to be the only way I like working: directly alongside a developer, making the left/right sides of the brain work together and appreciating each other's role.</p>

					<p>Eventually I shadowed our art director and moved on to storyboarding design ideas and meeting with clients. The company grew, modestly, and we sought more ambitious work. Most of us led double lives as musicians, actors and visual artists. I spent nights re-wiring old synthesizers and making sound collages. I remembered my father's obsession with model rockets, and his father's obsession with ham radio and satellites. Once again I thinked my stars that the inclusive web didn't have requirements. CS degree, just a curiosity and desire to rip apart wires and just start wiring things.</p>

					<p>But during the day we lived the internet. We studied every emerging technology, built and designed our own e-commerce and publishing products and earned a reputation as a top studio in Virginia.</p>

					<p>Right as we'd been projects became repetitive and production felt laborious, CSS rapidly gained support. Suddenly there was another technique to obsess over. I realized the waves of new technologies would never stop. I knew I'd never get bored. Once again reminded me of exactly why I'd invested in the web as a career.</p>

					<p>Built custom news and calendaring apps, learned problem solving rather than glitz and Photoshop.

					<h3 class="narrow">2011-2013</h3>

					<p>sick of internet; wondered about its impact</p>

					<h3 class="narrow">2014-2015</h3>

					<p>everything exploded, never been more excited about direction of web</p>


					<h3 class="narrow">2015</h3>

					The number of entrypoints to making a career out of the Internet were multiplying.


					Late at night, every night, I clumsily combined photography, code, poetry and jokes. This sounds like pure sentimentality, but not a day goes by when I wonder how many writers and musicians at that time would have fallen through the tracks, career-wise, if the internet had not gone mainstream when it did.

					<p>Why read the long story? It is long after all. Structurally it is not much of a r&egravesum&egrave. This is not how I planned it. Bear with me. People who didn't come from technology or Computer Science can maybe relate: writing a professional summary without examining my own relationship to the web and what that means.</p>

					<p>There are any number of entrypoints to making a career out of the Internet which wasn't true in the old, weird days of the web. So that's what I'm thinking of: the pre-Millenial generation of writers, print designers and thinkers who did not come from a technology background and may have fallen through the cracks if the internet had not lifted them up creatively, culturally and economically. They maybe last generation young enough to remember childhood without wifi. Young enough to recognize the internet as a force of good and not the End of Days, and old enough to treat it with moderation.</p>

					<p>For example, in the late 1990s in Charlottesville, VA, a place and time where the influence of  Jefferson's university covered the town like a preppy fleece vest and academics like Jerome McGann (<em><a href="#"Hypertext Theory</a></em>) similarly embraced emerging internet protocols to explore the boundaries of fiction writing, opportunities were suddenly everywhere, and most of they didn't pay. If you're a man or woman of a certain age, maybe you can relate: suddenly just as you were already doubting the career prospects of that recent liberal arts degree, evey hoardy old academics were experimenting with the new medium. Writing a computer program suddenly felt more like William Foster. You think, <em>I need to be a part of this</em>.</p>

				

					<p>Just as began to calcify, new front-end, responsive, webfonts. This is why I'm doing this. This is why the wave never ends, like teh Endless Summer</p>
